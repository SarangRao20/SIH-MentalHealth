        <p>
            The Inkblot test is a psychological assessment tool used to explore 
            personality characteristics and emotional functioning. It involves 
            interpreting ambiguous inkblot images and noting your responses.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are no right or wrong answers. The test helps you understand 
            your subconscious behavior and emotional responses.
